## My process
  1. Download the starter files from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd).
  2. Extract the .zip file to your desired folder. Open the design folder, check the preview of the project and understand the layout before coding. 
  3. Open the folder in VScode(or any other code editor).
  4. Open the index.html file and edit it. Create a .css file for the styles.
  5. Open the style-guide.md file to understand the page design.
  6. Open the README-template.md file, read the content and edit it to your taste. Rename it to Readme.md.
  7. The images you need are in the images folder.
  8. Create a repository on Github and upload your files to github.
  9. Submit the solution on  [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd/hub/flyo-dark-theme-landing-page-IWB7pfPrE/edit). 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 I had issues with the .svg files not behaving the way I wanted, I checked online and found out how to solve that issue using viewBox.
```html
      <svg x="0px" y="0px" width="176" height="52" viewBox="0 0 300 100" xmlns=""><g fill="#FFF" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d=""/></g></svg>

```

### Continued development
  Still working on responsiveness.



### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - A good online tutorial for Html and Css.
- [SVG viewBox](https://youtu.be/ciMsVVyv30g) - This is an amazing youtube video that helped me understand how to position a svg.
